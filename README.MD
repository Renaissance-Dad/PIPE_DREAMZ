# PIPE DREAMZ

In this tutorial we’ll be recreating the classic game “Pipe Dream”. "Pipe Dream" is a deceivingly simple but addictive puzzler. 
The game saw its first releason on the Amiga back in 1989. In “Pipe Dream”, players build a pipeline to carry flowing liquid (flooz) from a starting point to an endpoint before time runs out. 
The gameplay revolves around placing random pipe segments onto a grid. By connecting them in a way that forms a continuous path and creating loops and crossings while doing so, you score points. 
As you advance through the levels, the difficulty increases with faster flooz, various fixed obstacles and and more exotic pipe segments.
